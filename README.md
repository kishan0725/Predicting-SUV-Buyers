# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

Here I predict whether a person can buy Sport Utility Vehicle(SVM) based on his/her Age and Estimated Salary.

And also tested each and every Classification Algorithms with my problem and check its Accuracy

Following are the algorithm that I implemented in my problem
    
    1)Logistic Regression
    2)Decision Tress Classifier
    3)Random Forest Classifier
    4)Naive Bayes
    5)Support Vector Machine
    6)K Nearest Neighbors
